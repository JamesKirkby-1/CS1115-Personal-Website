                <h4>Scuba Diving</h4>
                <p>As I enjoy participating in water-based sports, I am certified as a PADI Open Water Diver. This qualification means I can dive anywhere in the world, up to 18 meters deep.</p>
                <p>In the future, I hope to visit many different dive sites in countries such as Hawaii, Australia, Egypt and Iceland.</p>
                <p>I am also a member of the UCC Subaqua club.</p>

                <h4>Athletics</h4>
                <p>From a young age, I have had an interest in track and field events such as the discus and hammer throw.</p>
                <p>I have focused on training the discus throw and have represented my club (Leevale AC) at both national and international level.</p>
                <p>I usually compete in national championships, but I have competed internationally in countries such as Portugal and the UK.</p>

                <h4>Video Games</h4>    
                <p>Since I was a child, I have been fascinated by the world of gaming. From genres such as first person shooters to action and adventure, I have played many different types of video games.</p>
                <p>My favourite video game of all time is The Witcher 3, which is based in a medieval world complete with monsters and mythical creatures.</p>
                <p>My preferred platform is playing on PC and I often use Steam to run and launch my games.</p>
